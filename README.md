# Random-Python-Scripts
Some random python scripts I made to kill time/make life easier

For their individual functionalities, look below
## lyricfetcher.py
Accesses input.txt in the same directory, and reads the first line for a word, and reads each following line for artist names. Now looks up each artist on lyrics.com and searches for the word in all songs of the artist. Generates out.txt, a text file which prints artist names in descending order of number of appearances.
